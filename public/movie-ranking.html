<h2>My Top movies of alltime</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Sanam Teri Kasam</h3>
<p>This movie holds a special place in my heart. It has everything a great movie should have first with perfect actors who molds themselves as character perfectly. The story is about a sweet, innocent, disciplined, hopelessly romantic Bhraman girl named Saraswati (saru called by her prince charm), paired with a lost, mad-at-love, angry, prisoner, broken man named Inder. A story with perfect twists and turns, which I call (perfect magical timing). This film will leave its mark on your heart which I hope will give you endless cries and it also help you to get your standard high.</p>

<h3>Piku</h3>
<p>This movie is my comfort film. It's slow-moving with a simple story which we all can relate to, it's about a father-daughter duo played by Deepika Padukone and Amitabh Bachchan a Bengali family, and a businessman Irfan Khan. A strong, independent woman with an old father meets a patient, funny man by destiny to complete the puzzle called life. It hits differently. It has a soothing story with excellent dialogue.</p>

<h3>Dear Comrade</h3>
<p>This movie will leave you with a motto to live a peaceful life and to take a stand for ourselves and our loved ones. Dear comrade means being a part of someone else pain basically, being a part of their journey and helping them grow, which will lead to your growth. But the thing I personally believe is to be that someone in your own pain and journey of growth, then help others to stand up for themselves. This story has a boy named Bobby a student, a comrade basically a hot young blood paired with Lilly a sweet, ambitious, state cricket player girl who fall in love with each other, and at the end of the story they rise in each other's love. </p>

<h3>Wake up sid</h3>
<p> It's my personal motivational movie. This movie is for people who are looking for themselves and who think that they know themselves. It gives you hope and helps you to believe in yourselves. It's best for young and aspiring, who want to be something, to do something. This movie will help you to hold on to your hopes and show you how to find sunshine in the darkness. This story has a young, rich father's son, a student, an immature boy paired with Bengali ambitious, a writer. A girl who moved to Mumbai. This story will give us peace and strength to find peace within ourselves. </p>
